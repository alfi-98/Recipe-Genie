# Recipe-Genie
Recipe Genie is a recipe app that uses the power of AI to generate recipes based on the ingredients and cuisine types you provide. The app is built with React Native and leverages the ChatGPT API from OpenAI to generate recipe ideas and suggestions.

With Recipe Genie, users can simply input the ingredients they have on hand and the cuisine type they're in the mood for, and the app will generate a list of recipe ideas for them to try. The app also includes a chatbot feature that allows users to ask questions or get additional recipe suggestions from the AI-powered chatbot.

The Recipe Genie app is designed with a simple, user-friendly interface that makes it easy to browse through recipes and save favorites for later. The app also includes features like ingredient lists, step-by-step instructions, and nutritional information to help users create delicious and healthy meals at home.

This GitHub repo includes all the source code for the Recipe Genie app, as well as documentation on how to set up the ChatGPT API and integrate it with the app. Users can also submit bug reports or feature requests through the repo's issue tracker.
